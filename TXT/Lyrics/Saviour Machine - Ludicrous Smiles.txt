Saviour Machine - Ludicrous Smiles

Sanity falls by the knife
That lacerates the brain
Listen to the pain
touch the empty space within our hearts
And see the dream is our reality

Stand upon the edge, fall into the water
Drift upon the sea, pray for all the others
Suffering to see

The Ludicrous Smiles on our faces
Show nothing remains
In fortress surrounding the dream
The Ludicrous Smiles in our eyes
See the fall of the rain
And the coming of what is to be
The lunatic hides in the night
From the man of the sane
In a world that imprisons the free
Terrified of what he sees
The Ludicrous Smiles, The Ludicrous Smiles
Smiles over me

Shadows may follow the man
One thing is leading the others
Follow the veil in my hand
Nothing deceiving my brothers
Look into my eyes, walk into my vision
Drift upon the streams, enter vast dominions
Welcome to my dream

The Ludicrous Smiles on our faces
Show nothing remains
In fortress surrounding the dream
The Ludicrous Smiles in our eyes
See the fall of the rain
And the coming of what is to be
The lunatic hides in the night
From the man of the sane
In a world that imprisons the free
The lunatic smiles over me
Terrified of what he sees
The ludicrous mind
