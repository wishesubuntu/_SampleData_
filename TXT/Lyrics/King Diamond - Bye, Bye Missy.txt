King Diamond - "Bye, Bye Missy"

Tea Time Monday Night, I Was Waiting Passing Time
Then From The Hallway, I Saw Mother In Her Nightgown
Swaying Up The Stairs, Up The Stairs, It Seemed So Unreal
I Knew Grandma' Had Sent "Them" Again, The Invisible Friends

A Little Later In The Middle Of Tea We Came Close To Ecstacy
"They" Were Telling Tales From Beyond When Grandma' Rose

She Opened The Door, And There Was Missy
Seeing Mother In Grandmother's Chair, She Went Into Tears

Missy Was Screaming
"What Have You Done, What Have You Done To My Ma", Crying Louder Now
"We Better Get Rid Of Her, She's Too Young Anyway", It Was Grandma' Who
Spoke

"Bye, Bye Missy, Be Gone Forever
The Beautiful Fireplace In The Kitchen Will Do"

I Saw Missy Struggling In Grandma' Wrinkled Hands
"Oh No, Let Me Be, Oh No Please No
Grandma' Please
Aagh Grandma' You're Hurting Me
Don't Touch Me Or I'll Break It, I've Got The Tea Pot, I'll Do It Anyway"
I Saw Liquid Spreading, The Bloody Tea All Over The Floor
Now I Heard "Their" Voices, Some Kind Of Demon Growls
Die.. She Broke Amon.. Amon.. Die

"They" Dropped "Their" Tea Cups
Grandma' Stood Still Forced By Invisible Hands, Missy Went Down The Stairs
As I Waved Her Goodbye, Missy Was Sobbing Away

Will I Ever See Her Again, Bye Bye
Missy, Don't Be Afraid
