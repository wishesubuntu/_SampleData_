I could move to Hollywood, yeah
Get my teeth capped I know I could
Be a big star on the silver screen
Just like James Dean, I could be a star

I could climb the corporate ladder
Buy, sell, and liquidate
Maybe be just like the Beatles
Melodic, rocking heavyweights
I could learn to sing and dance
If I only had a chance, I could be a big rock star

I could be anything I wanted to, yeah
I could be anything but one thing's true

Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna hold the world in my hands
Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna build a promised land
But that's, that's alright, okay with me

I could build a tower to heaven
Get on top and touch the sky
I could write a million songs
All designed to glorify
I could be about as good
Good as any human could, but that won't get me by

I could be anything I wanted to, hey yeah
I could do anything but one thing's true

Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna hold the world in my hands
Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna build a promised land
But that's, that's alright, okay with me

I could be anything I wanted to
I could do anything but one thing's true

Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna hold the world in my hands, yeah
Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna build a promised land
But that's, that's alright, it's okay with me, yeah

Never gonna be, never gonna be
Never gonna be, never gonna be
Never gonna be, never gonna be
As big as Jesus, as big as Jesus

Never gonna be, never gonna be
Never gonna be, never gonna be
Never gonna be, never gonna be
As big as Jesus, as big as Jesus, oh yeah

Never gonna be, never gonna be
Never gonna be, never gonna be
Never gonna be, never gonna be
As big as Jesus, as big as Jesus
