In this mask engraved I'm under, a masquerade of thunder
Calling out, you wonder who I am
I can hear you screaming to the bells I'm ringing
Pardon me, you're dreaming, I'm your nightmare's end

I'm a lost child facing a confrontation
I'm just a figment of your imagination
I'm a snake in the grass offering temptation

I'm the master of disguise
I can see you watching from the corner of my eyes
I'm the master of disguise
I'm dressed to kill, tonight

In a blaze of glory, I'm another story told
In a schizophrenic scene
I'm a mad creation, dressed in black, mutation
I'm every mother's dream

I'm a lost child facing a confrontation
I'm just a figment of your imagination
I'm a snake in the grass offering temptation

I'm the living image, cast a shadow blackened passed
The mirror of our lies
In this theatre of cruelty obscurely under wraps
The curtain will arise

I'm the master of disguise
I can see you watching from the corner of my eyes
I'm the master of disguise
I'm dressed to kill, tonight

I'm the master of disguise
I'm the wolf in a pack of lies
I'm the master of disguise
