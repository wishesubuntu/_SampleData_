Saviour Machine - Carnival Of Souls

Unto the Gods I call your name
The crucifixion of my brain
As I wait for you

Into the field, I've lost my way
I've opened veins just for the day
As I wait for you

The thoughts that linger in my head
They cry out for the dead
As they wait for you
Call my name, Call my name

Into the Carnival of Souls
Surrendered to the fight
They dance upon the edge
They dance upon the night
To wake up in the dark
And find they've lost their way
Their way back to the door
Their way back to the light

I've opened doors, I've opened minds
I've opened yours a thousand times
As I wait for you

I've fought the battle from the start
I've opened sores inside my heart
It bleeds without remorse

The thought that linger in my heard
They cry out for the dead
As they wait for you
Call my name, Call my name

Into the Carnival of Souls
Surrendered to the fight
They dance upon the edge
They dance upon the night
To wake up in the dark
And find they've lost their way
Their way back to the door
Their way back to the light

(Unto the Gods, IE Hebrew Trinity - Father, Son, Holy Spirt)
