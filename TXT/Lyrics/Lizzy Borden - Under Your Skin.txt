[Verse 1]
In the dark where you feel connected
Hide away from they you were rejected
Crumbling walls in there you won't survive
When I touch you where you hurt
While I skin you alive

[Chorus]
I wanna crawl down under your skin
I wanna go where no one's ever been
I wanna crawl down under your skin
I wanna strip away the pain

[Verse 2]
Look at you, you're sick and self infected
Ain't got a clue of who you see reflected
Empty eyes of vacant suffocating
Drowning in your vanity you're disintegrating

[Chorus]
I wanna crawl down under your skin
I wanna go where no one's ever been
I wanna crawl down under your skin
I wanna strip away the pain

[Bridge]
Who you are is what I wanna be
So bizarre so insane
Where you are is where I wanna be
How we are is all in vain


[Chorus]
I wanna crawl down under your skin
I wanna get to where I've never been
I wanna crawl down under your skin
I wanna lick away the pain
Now we are all the same
Now we are all the pain
