My old man's that old man,
Spent his life livin' off the land,
Dirty hands, and a clean soul.
It breaks his heart seein' foreign cars,
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearin' cotton we didn't grow

He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
"Semper Fi" tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says 'USA'
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix,
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

He loves his wife and she's that wife
That decorates on the Fourth of July
But says 'Every day's Independence Day'
She's golden rule, teaches school,
Some folks say it isn't cool
But she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway.

He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
"Semper Fi" tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says 'USA'
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix,
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

Born in the Heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
"Semper Fi" tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says 'USA'
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix,
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America
Made in America
Made in America

My old man's that old man,
Made in America
