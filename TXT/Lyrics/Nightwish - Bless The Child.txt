Nightwish - Bless The Child

“I was born amidst the purple waterfalls. 
I was weak, yet not unblessed. 
Dead to the world. Alive for the journey. 
One night I dreamt a white rose withering, 
a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness. 
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past. 
A witnessed the beauty of the beast” 
Where have all the feelings gone? 
Why has all the laughter ceased? 
Why am I loved only when I’m gone? 
Gone back in time to bless the child 
Think of me long enough to make a memory 
Come bless the child one more time 
How can I ever feel again? 
Given the chance would I return? 
I’ve never felt so alone in my life 
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time 
There’s a poison drop in this cup of Man 
To drink it is to follow the left hand path 
“Where have all the feelings gone? 
Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you? 
Now unblessed, homesick in time, 
soon to be freed from care, from human pain. 
My tale is the most bitter truth: 
Time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark, silent grave. 
Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron, 
hope is only an illusion & Ocean Soul’s nothing but a name… 
The Child bless thee & keep thee forever”
