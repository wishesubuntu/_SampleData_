Death comes sweeping through the hallway, like a lady's dress
Death comes driving down the highway, in it's Sunday best

A fire of unknown origin took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin took my baby away

Swept to ruin off my wavelength, swallowed her up
Like the ocean in a fire, so thick and gray

A fire of unknown origin took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin took my baby away

Death comes driving - I can't do nothing! Death goes.
There must be something - there must be something that remains
Something... something...

A fire of unknown origin took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin took my baby away
