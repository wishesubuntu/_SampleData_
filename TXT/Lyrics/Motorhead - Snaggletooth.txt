Stand back

Thought I was done for now
Well, here's a big surprise
Cause I keep coming back
I can't be exorcised

I'm like a nightmare, babe
And I'm here to mess with you
I'll make your hair stand up
And I'll make your lips turn blue

I'm gonna raise your roof
I'll ring your bell and that's the truth
Speed don't kill and I'm the proof
Just call me Snaggletooth

I just been waiting here
And you were late again
But I knew you'd be back
I hoped you'd bring your friend
I want you to believe
That there is no way out
You're in the snakepit, babe
There's a lot of it about
