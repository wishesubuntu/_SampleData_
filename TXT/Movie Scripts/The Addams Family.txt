FADE IN: 
A1 EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE A1 
A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an 
endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy." 
They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they 
pompously begin their umpteenth verse, 
THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past 
the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows, 
weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter. 
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF 
where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY, 
PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler, 
gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH 
over the edge. 
AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE 
BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
1 INT. DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN O'CLOCK A.M. 1 
C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK -- 
The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY 
HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour. 
In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a 
MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet 
and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage. 
One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward 
seven o'clock. 
IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a 
MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and 
down. 
Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop 
where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine. 
The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL 
LURCH appears and begins sweeping. 
Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the 
full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back 
of the clock. 
Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall. 
LOW TRACKING SHOT 
follows Thing along the hallway.

He runs past a couple of doors, past a pair of LEGS in 
pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt 
and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of 
the pajama bottoms. They belong to GOMEZ, who stands 
in the doorway to 
A2 INT. FESTER'S ROOM A2 
Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas. 
Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar. 
Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment, 
he radiates unfathomable woe. 
GOMEZ 
Think of it, Thing. He's been gone 
for twenty-five years. For twentyfive 
years we've attempted to 
contact Fester in the great 
beyond... 
The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine 
to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the 
doorway. 
The room has remained untouched since Fester's 
disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust 
and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth 
- a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports 
trophies, a high school photo with all the other students 
keeping as much distance from Fester as possible. 
As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room: 
GOMEZ 
... And for twenty-five years, 
nothing. Not a whisper, not a 
clue. I'm beginning to think my 
my brother truly is lost. 
Gomez sighs. Thing TUGS at his cuff, pulling him towards 
the

Galloping ahead of Gomez, Thing leaps onto an 
old-fashioned door latch and the door swings open INTO

GOMEZ 
(gazing at Morticia) 
Look at her -- I would die for her. 
I would kill for her. Either way 
-- what bliss. 
Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles 
are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is 
offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair 
is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry 
and remote, she's a ruined beauty. 
Morticia OPENS HER EYES.
GOMEZ 
(adoringly) 
Unhappy, darling? 
MORTICIA 
(passionately) 
Oh, yes, yes. Completely.

Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized 
chemistry set. 
The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's 
collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!", 
"Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!" 
SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked 
in the corner. 
In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING 
FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA. 
This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has 
every chance of growing up to be the public monster his 
parents would be proud of. 
He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams. Grinning 
wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down. 
He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transformation, 
then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he 
crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

Solemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black 
hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool 
among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A 
STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR. 
The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head 
through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in 
the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in. 
Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string. 
WEDNESDAY 
Thank you, Grandmama. 
In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic. 
GRANNY 
You kids are going to have to kill 
your own breakfast this morning. 
Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted 
human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a 
collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in 
the box.

table beside her, Morticia's OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS 
ORCHID WILTS. 
MORTICIA

He kisses his way up to her neck, then, suddenly 
bursting with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose, LEAPS 
from the bed, drawing his bedside saber from its sheath 
and BRANDISHING it at the offending beam. 
GOMEZ 
En garde monsieur sole! 
He thrusts and parries, pantomiming a duel with the 
shaft of light. 
MORTICIA 
Gomez? 
GOMEZ 
Querida?

Last night, you were... unhinged. 
You were like some desperate,

It's a milestone, Tish. This very

All those years, gnawed by guilt, 
undone by woe, burning with 
uncertainty...

Oh Gomez, don't torture yourself. 
That's my job.

TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET, 
approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of 
its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and 
Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be 
startled by "Gate." 
Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered 
grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent. 
High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disappointed 
in Tully than he is in himself. 
Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes 
through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the 
end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat. 
TULLY 
Let me go! 
Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk. 
TULLY

Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning 
you! It's not a good day!

No loans! I'm not a bum. 
(before Margaret 
can reply) 
Don't say it. I'll get the money, 
I've got a plan. 
MARGARET 
This is all so humiliating. Why 
did I marry you? 
TULLY 
Because I said yes. 
Margaret marches on toward the front door, skirting the fog 
machine as if it had every reason to be there. It hisses 
at Tully as he passes, splattering his trousers with fog. 
CUT TO: 
C15 INT. ENTRY HALL - A LITTLE LATER C15 
Tully hands his hat to Lurch and marches off toward 
Gomez's study. Finding herself alone with Lurch, 
Margaret is more nervous and intimidated than she would

I'm here to see Mrs. Addams. About 
the charity auction. 
Growling, Lurch heads for the stairs. Screwing up her 
courage, Margaret resolutely follows.

Tully, preoccupied, strides toward the rug. There's a 
sudden FEROCIOUS GROWL as he steps on it. 
TULLY 
Damn! 
He kicks at the rug. It BITES him, clamping its jaws 
onto his trouser cuff. He flails, dancing around, 
finally managing to shake it off. He finds himself 
FACE-TO-FACE with one of the paintings... 
A PORTRAIT OF THE TEENAGE FESTER ADDAMS 
draped in black crepe and HOLDING A LIT CANDLE, though 
how it is holding a lit candle is an utter mystery. At 
fifteen, Fester was utterly hairless with a dead white 
complexion and eyes rimmed in black like a raccoon's. 
The identifying plaque reads "Fester Addams, 1947 - ?" 
TULLY 
regards the portrait intently, almost as if having a 
premonition. 
THE INTRICATELY CARVED DOORS TO GOMEZ'S STUDY

Tully proceeds inside.

What's that?! 
Gomez turns to see and Tully CHARGES, wielding the sword 
as if he means to decapitate Gomez. But Gomez easily 
PARRIES the blow. 
GOMEZ 
Dirty pool, old man! I like it! 
Gomez counters, driving Tully back. He shreds Tully's 
jacket. 
TULLY 
Had enough? 
They continue to fence. Gomez flips Tully's briefcase 
open and a sheaf of legal looking papers spills out. 
GOMEZ 
Where's my pen? Never mind, I'll 
use yours. 
His blade finds the pen in Tully's inside jacket pocket. 
He does HANDSPRINGS back to his desk, landing gracefully 
in his chair.

scattered before him.

TULLY 
What wouldn't they do? It's a very 
worthy cause and a great addition to 
the other Fester Addams Funds.

Fester - all tribute to thee. Some 
called him inhumanly evil.

No!

Fine lunge, but your riposte -

Then it turns back to its original position. 
Tully gets to his feet, goes through the doors, and 
staggers for the bookcase.

Mother warned you, Margaret. I can 
still hear her voice, clear as a 
bell, she'd always say, day in and 
day out, "Marry Tully Alford..." 
TULLY 
"... And you'll hear Satan laugh." 
Here's your doubloon. 
MARGARET

CUT TO: 
C27 INT. TULLY'S LAW OFFICE - LATER C27 
Tully enters the secretary's alcove, still lugging his 
impossibly heavy briefcase. His offices were once quite 
elegant, but now the leather on the chairs is starting to 
crack and a repainting is long overdue. 
Tully looks around for his secretary. 
TULLY 
Miss Bradbury ...

Miss Bradbury!
ABIGAIL (O.S.) 
She's at lunch, Mr. Alford. 
Alarmed, Tully steps into 
D27 INT. TULLY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME D27 
Sitting in a chair on the client's side of Tully's desk is 
ABIGAIL CRAVEN, an arrogant, aristocratic-seeming 60ish 
doyenne. Her steely will and conniving manipulativeness 
are barely veiled by a thin layer of polish and good 
manners.

Instantly obsequious, Tully sets his heavy briefcase on his

TULLY 
Mrs. Craven, I was just about to 
call you. 
ABIGAIL 
I'm certain you were. 
(she gestures) 
You haven't met my son, Gordon, have 
have you, Mr. Alford? 
Tully turns amiably, but his face falls at the sight of: 
GORDON CRAVEN - 
Fleshy and round, in his 40's, impeccably if eccentrically 
dressed, his dark hair plastered with pomade. With his 
barrel chest and his kamikaze demeanor, he is IMMEDIATELY 
THREATENING. 
Tully blanches. 
GORDON 
Is this the one, Mother? The 
deadbeat you mentioned? 
Before Tully can react, Gordon has him by the throat, 
hanging him upside down from the wall like an oil painting. 
TULLY 
(choking) 
Wait a minute, hold on! You have 
to listen to me! 
ABIGAIL 
We do, Mr. Alford? And why? 
TULLY 
Please... Just hear me out... 
GORDON 
Mother... your call. 
ABIGAIL

Gordon and I enjoy a very... special 
relationship. I'm wild about him.

TULLY 
Gordon! 
Gordon lets go, dropping him on his head. Whimpering, Tully 
crawls toward his desk. 
ABIGAIL 
And how is your wife, Mr. Alford? I've 
heard so much about her. Still 
charming? Still spending? 
TULLY 
I don't have the money to repay you... 
I've tried everything... 
ABIGAIL 
We've lent you a considerable sum. Many 
thousands of dollars. Payment due. 
TULLY 
Soon, I promise. 
ABIGAIL 
Oh, Gordon - I want to believe him... 
GORDON 
So do I... 
ABIGAIL 
(re: Gordon) 
He's so terribly trusting. 
GORDON 
She's a saint.

Silly boy... make me proud.

TULLY'S BRIEFCASE 
pops open as it hits the floor. The Addams' doubloons 
SPILL OUT. 
Abigail and Gordon light up at the sight of the gold. They 
share a malicious smile. Gordon leers down at the battered 
Tully. 
GORDON 
He lied to us, Mother. 
TULLY 
(babbling hysterically) 
It's not what you think! Those are 
doubloons! For the Addams account! 
ABIGAIL 
Addams? 
TULLY 
There's more, there's a fortune, but 
no one can get to it! Don't you think 
I've tried? 
ABIGAIL 
Have you? Have you tried hard 
enough? Ask him, Sweetheart. 
Gordon descends on Tully, menacingly. 
TULLY 
No! Sweetheart! Don't ask! 
TULLY'S CRINGING POV 
Gordon's face hovers inches from his own. The glare from 
the lightbulb hanging overhead whites out Gordon's hair -- 
making Gordon look as bald as a cue-ball. 
It's like a sudden vision. The inspiration is obviously 
born of terror. Gordon is the SPITTING IMAGE OF THE 
LONG-LOST FESTER, as he would appear twenty-five years 
later. 
TULLY, 
disbelieving, comes nose-to-nose with Gordon. 
TULLY 
(in a shocked, 
croaky whisper) 
Fester...? 
Gordon makes a face at his mother.

GORDON 
So can I... 
ABIGAIL

Just one week and out. You locate 
the vault and then we're gone - 
poof! Before they notice what's

GORDON

We need him - for now. And later, 
we'll be miles away, and he'll

Abigail holds up a shaving brush, covered with foam.

Pugsley laughs appreciatively. 
Margaret tries to shake Thing off, but he hangs on

Sit down, Pumpkin. Join the fun.

There on the front steps stands GORDON -- FESTER FROM 
BEYOND. Gordon's head is completely shaved, and his 
clothing and pallor are pure Fester. The exact 
resemblance is shocking. It seems a miracle. 
Gomez and Fester stare at each other. Fester's eyes 
have a hard, I-dare-you-to-question-me look in them. 
Neither man says a word.

Morticia looks to Gomez for confirmation. Gomez and 
Fester continue their face-off. 
Gomez breaks the stalemate. 
GOMEZ 
Fester! 
FESTER 
Gomez! 
Gomez throws open his arms. He smothers Fester in an 
embrace. Fester endures it. Abigail steps forward; she 
now wears a plain, dowdy suit, and her hair is in braided 
coils. She now speaks in a German/Austrian accent.

mattress so deeply that he's almost buried alive. 
Getting comfortable, he burrows deeper. 
CLOSEUP - FESTER'S EYES. Who knows what terrors they've 
seen? But now they lose their coldness, getting dreamy, 
then he hears the creak of his door opening...

A SHADOW -- 
thrown huge on the wall. A SINISTER HAND WITH WRIGGLING 
FINGERS. 
FESTER -- 
goes for the knife he keeps in his boot, which is next 
to the bed, on the floor. The door slams. Veins in his 
forehead bulge.

Fester had no idea a simple exchange could be so fraught 
with pitfalls. He already feels cornered. 
FESTER 
(condescendingly to 
Wednesday) 
The Bermuda Triangle is such a 
large and mysterious place. You'd be 
surprised at all the things you don't 
know. 
MORTICIA 
She certainly would. Wednesday adores 
the Bermuda Triangle. She studies it. 
Death at sea - she's hooked. 
WEDNESDAY 
Ask me anything. 
Fester turns his back on Wednesday and addresses Gomez. 
FESTER 
Being in my old room sure brings back 
memories. Remember Camp Custer? 
GOMEZ

For pre-teen offenders?

Hanging our stockings... 
GOMEZ 
Building a fire. 
Gomez and Fester laugh mischievously. 
FESTER 
Aren't memories precious? I'd like 
to spend today wandering through the 
house, remembering. 
GOMEZ 
No, no, no. Sorry, old man - no 
wandering today. Today we're going 
straight to the vault. 
Pugsley runs into the room, dragging a freshly-stolen STOP 
SIGN, still on its pole. Gomez holds up a finger, shushing 
everyone. 
Just then, the (O.S.) SCREECHING SOUND OF CARS heading for 
a collision is heard. Finally, the CARS COLLIDE. There is 
a satisfying crunch of metal. Everyone beams. 
GRANNY 
Who wants seconds? 
Something in Granny's soup tureen YELPS. Granny, keeping 
her eyes on Fester, jabs her ladle into the tureen.

Gomez looks up. Over his head hang HUNDREDS OF RUSTY 
CHAINS. 
Gomez grabs one of the chains. As he does so, he punches 
Fester on the shoulder.

Gomez pulls the chain, and he and Fester DROP OUT OF VIEW,

Gomez strides to the end of the dock. Waiting there is a 
VENETIAN GONDOLA, rundown but still magnificent. Gomez 
does a running leap to board the gondola. He puts on a 
straw gondolier's hat and calls out to Fester... 
GOMEZ 
Tutti a bordo, fratello mio! 
(gesturing to the 
water) 
The sea - your second home. 
Fester boards the gondola gingerly, looking queasy. 
FESTER 
Ship ahoy... 
Gomez winds an old Victrola as he sorts through a pile of

There are a half-dozen excellent brandies on the wellstocked

chooses a bottle AND THE BAR SPINS AROUND with Fester, 
revealing... 
THE INTERIOR TREASURE ROOM -- 
A STONE CAVERN stacked high with ADDAMS TREASURE -- gold,

Young Gomez has buried young Fester in the sand at the 
beach. Only Fester's head appears from beneath a mound. A 
few yards away, a single hand struggles out of the sand, 
clearly another person. The film JUMP CUTS to: 
A hand-held 16mm camera weaves its way through a group of 
ball-goers, finally focussing on a head and shoulders shot 
of Gomez and Fester, now in their teens. The Addams boys

Gomez sighs, and then becomes extremely dramatic. 
GOMEZ 
Can you ever forgive me? 
FESTER 
What? 
GOMEZ 
I didn't love them. Yet, I wooed 
them, both, out of foolish pride. 
You were so dashing, you could have 
any woman you wanted, dead or alive. 
I was jealous, insanely jealous. 
I admit that now. But I never meant 
to drive you off, not to the Bermuda 
Triangle.

Remember, the money we raise goes

him, waiting for him, her velvet cloak covering her night 
clothes. 
MORTICIA 
(pointedly) 
Sleepless night? Walk with me, 
Fester. 
She turns and glides away. Fester has no choice but to 
follow. 
CUT TO: 
74 EXT. BACK OF HOUSE/THE CEMETERY - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 74 
Morticia leads Fester into the chill of the cemetery. 
They follow a path that winds among the ELABORATE TOMBSTONES 
of the Addams dead. Gomez's golfballs are 
everywhere -- on the ground, in statues' upturned hands, 
in their open mouths. 
As they pass them, Morticia points out various monuments. 
The marble statues look so real they could be alive. 
MORTICIA 
Aunt Laborgia - executed by a firing 
squad. Cousin Fledge - torn limb from 
limb by four wild horses. And darling 
Uncle Eimar... 
Uncle Eimar is a hooded executioner with an upraised ax. 
There is an UNEARTHLY MOAN, seeming to come from the tomb. 
MORTICIA 
Buried alive. Psychopaths, fiends, 
mad-dog killers - roots, Fester. 
Pioneers. Lest we forget. 
Among the statuary is a MARBLE VULTURE, posed with the 
dignity of an eagle on a flagpole, but the flagpole 
is actually a replica of Fester's bald head.

MORTICIA 
Your beloved Muerto. After you 
left, he was simply... a different 
vulture. He wouldn't circle. He 
wouldn't peck. That's how much 
you mean to this family. 
They reach the MAUSOLEUM where MOTHER AND FATHER ADDAMS 
lie. It stands on a knoll, the HIGHEST POINT IN THE 
CEMETERY. 
Poison ivy covers the dilapidated Greco-Roman tomb. 
Mother and Father Addams have been depicted as a god and 
a goddess, charioteers driving their steeds to the 
netherworld. Father Addams smokes the ubiquitous Addams 
cigar. 
Morticia gazes up at the likenesses of Mother and Father 
Addams. But Fester averts his eyes -- the faces seem 
to be STARING DIRECTLY AT HIM. 
MORTICIA 
Mother and Father Addams... 
Imagine what we owe them. Oh, Fester, 
how I wish the children could have 
known them better. But tell that to 
an angry mob. 
She turns to trace the FAMILY CREST, carved into the 
mausoleum. THE TOP OF THE CREST IS A VULTURE. THE 
BACKGROUND IS COMPOSED OF THREE LION'S HEADS -- IN ONE 
PANEL, A HUNTSMAN HOLDS OPEN THE LION'S HEAD; IN 
ANOTHER PANEL, THE LION HAS SWALLOWED HIM UP TO HIS 
TORSO; IN THE LAST PANEL, THE LION HAS SWALLOWED THE 
HUNTSMAN COMPLETELY BUT FOR ONE DANGLING FOOT. ON A 
BANNER AT THE BOTTOM IS THE FAMILY MOTTO IN LATIN. 
MORTICIA 
Three lions rampant. The 
vulture ascendant. And our 
credo "Sic gorgiamus allos 
subjectatos nunc." 
"We gladly feast on those who 
would subdue us." 
(reflective) 
Not just pretty words. As an 
Addams, you understand completely, 
don't you? 
She stares levelly at him. 
FESTER 
As an Addams, yes, I do.

sure!... Of course, I've tried, I still 
can't find it... you've got to get 
over here. 
Wednesday is bound and gagged on a chair in the background. 
Pugsley runs up to Fester with two bottles of poison. 
Fester, vaguely impatient, points to one. Pugsley nods and 
runs off.

His trains are everywhere, the children 
are beside themselves - this can't go on. 
How can I help him? Tell me, Mama. 
GRANNY 
Well, let's look it up. 
Granny wipes her hands and opens a large, ragged leatherbound 
book. She starts thumbing through the pages. 
GRANNY 
Troubled husbands, troubled husbands... 
adultery... 
MORTICIA 
Oh, no.

Financial, money troubles... 
MORTICIA 
No.

MORTICIA

I can't do that. It's barbaric. Really,

Milk.

He's suspicious, they all are, I can

He hurries back to the

Morticia is standing in the moonlight. Gomez sits on a 
bench nearby. 
MORTICIA 
What a sublime evening. A 
theatrical triumph... 
GOMEZ 
A Shakespearean delight! All hail Fester! 
MORTICIA 
It's like a dream. When we first met, 
years ago, it was an evening much like 
this. Magic in the air. A boy... 
GOMEZ 
A girl... 
MORTICIA 
(nostalgically 
sitting beside Gomez) 
An open grave... It was my first 
funeral. 
GOMEZ 
You were so beautiful - pale, and 
mysterious. No one even looked at 
the corpse. 
MORTICIA 
Your cousin, Balthazar. You were 
still a suspect. I couldn't stop 
staring, all during the eulogy. Your 
eyes. Your moustache. Your laugh. 
GOMEZ 
(aglow with romance) 
You bewitched me. I proposed that 
very night. 
MORTICIA 
(gazing at the cemetery) 
Just think - someday we'll be buried 
here. Side by side, six feet under. 
In matching coffins. Our lifeless 
bodies, rotting together, for all 
eternity.

Did you like the blood? 
FESTER 
Perfect - a full bucket. I was so 
proud. 
MORTICIA 
Weren't we all. Wednesday, play 
with your food. 
Wednesday has SOMETHING MOVING in her cereal bowl. She 
teases it with her fork. 
Granny SCREAMS, at the sideboard. 
MORTICIA 
Mama? 
Granny pulls a SKELETON OF A SHIN AND FOOT out of one of 
the serving dishes. 
GRANNY 
Who put this in here? 
Pugsley and Fester exchange a conspiratorial glance and 
giggle. 
GRANNY 
(referring to the 
skeleton) 
That's for company! 
GOMEZ 
(shaking his head, 
amused) 
Rascals. 
Abigail enters, peeling off bits of the vines that had

Jais, he does.

Well, if he insists upon leaving, we 
shall mark the occasion. Tish? 
MORTICIA 
(to Fester) 
We've planned a farewell party. 
GOMEZ 
We've invited the whole clan. 
Amazed by the gesture, Fester looks over at Gomez and 
Morticia. 
ABIGAIL 
Vat a luffly gesture. 
MORTICIA 
(gazing at her family) 
Bloodshed... anguish... breakfast... 
We're a family again. And we owe

Each carrying a lighted candelabra, Morticia, Gomez, 
Fester, Granny, Lurch, Pugsley, and Wednesday stand in 
front of the tall, elaborately carved, oaken double 
doors. Gomez unlatches them. Together they push them 
open and STEP into the 
BALLROOM 
Moonlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, 
revealing the true enormity of the ballroom. 
It's straight out of a ROCOCO palace. A lofty unsupported 
dome ceiling is DECORATED with figures worthy of Dante. 
The black marble floor glistens. The furniture and banquet 
tables are FUNEREALLY SHROUDED. Like some primeval sea, 
the shrouds undulate in the breeze admitted through the 
open doors. 
Gomez steps up to Morticia and embraces her. They begin 
to dance. 
Fester remains frozen in the center of the ballroom, 
overwhelmed by the grandeur. 
FESTER 
A party... for me... here...

Gomez and Morticia, resplendent now in their party

sheath, and Gomez in black velvet lounging pajamas, 
smoking jacket and fez. 
A SMALL ORCHESTRA plays a FRACTURED WALTZ. Thing is a 
third hand on the bass. 
Gomez and Morticia dance among the ADDAMS FAMILY RELATIVES 
-- that portrait gallery of GROTESQUES come to 
life. Among them are: 
DEXTER AND DONALD ADDAMS, the two-headed cousin in 
matching turtlenecks. 
COUSIN OPHELIA ADDAMS who looks like a Tennessee Williams 
heroine who's just been fished out of the Mississippi. 
SLOSH ADDAMS. If a man could look like a toad and 
still be a man, this is he. He's made many a killing 
on Wall Street. With him is his child-sized wife, LOIS. 
DIGIT ADDAMS, all four arms embrace his date, an over-age 
Heidi, with thick blonde braids. 
COUSIN LUMPY ADDAMS, a teenage hunchback in a loud 
blazer. 
Dexter and Donald dance Ophelia over to Gomez and 
Morticia.

Fester-- to Fester.

various pieces of clothing, on hangers or placed 
on the bed. Abigail stands nearby, her arms folded. 
FESTER 
What would look best? A tuxedo? 
ABIGAIL 
A nice dark suit is perfectly 
acceptable. 
FESTER 
But the whole family's coming! 
I want to look terrific! 
ABIGAIL 
Gordon, may I remind you - you're 
not really an Addams. 
FESTER 
I know, I know - but the party's

been summoned. He looks out; his face lights up as he 
sees a new arrival. 
ANGLE on COUSIN IT, driving up in his bubble-topped Itmobile. 
He parks the car and flips open the top. Cousin 
It is a hairball in a homburg, who gleeps and squeaks in 
a language the Addams have no trouble understanding. He 
pauses for a moment, to survey the house.

MORTICIA 
You're right. Far too long. 
Cousin It looks around, obviously checking out the women. 
He SEES--

It runs a hand through his hair, slicking it back, then 
excuses himself.

It's a formal occasion... 
MARGARET 
Don't let me out of your sight... 
TULLY 
Don't threaten me... 
There's a TAP on Margaret's shoulder. She turns. Before 
her is Cousin It, hat in hand, eager to cut in.

WEDNESDAY 
Uncle Fester? 
She hears the water running in Fester's bathroom, the 
sound of voices beneath it. 
INSIDE THE BATHROOM -- 
Fester turns off the water. The pipes make a final clang, 
then there's silence. 
FESTER 
Yes, Mother, I understand. I hear 
you. 
ABIGAIL 
I hope so, Gordon. I'm counting 
on you. Don't buckle. 
FESTER 
It's not going to be easy. There 
are people everywhere. 
ABIGAIL 
You can do it, if you just stop 
whining. No one likes that, it's 
unattractive. 
FESTER 
All right, fine. I will try and 
reach the vault tonight. But if 
I can't, well...

courage)

Abigail and Fester wheel around on her. The straight 
razor catches the light and GLINTS MENACINGLY. 
ABIGAIL 
Come here, little vun. Ve von't 
hurt you. 
Fester can't believe this is happening. He is genuinely 
torn and it shows. 
FESTER

Abigail's facade disintegrates and she bellows.

Get her!

Galvanized into action by the hold his mother still has 
on him, Fester KICKS the door open just in time to SEE: 
A104 INT. WEDNESDAY'S ROOM - SAME TIME A104 
Wednesday throws open a TRAPDOOR IN THE FLOOR and 
DISAPPEARS DOWN IT, pulling the door closed behind her. 
Fester tries to find it but, the door is seamless. He

B104 EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME B104 
Next to the coal chute where Abigail was grabbed by the

Granny turns the roast pig slightly to arrange the 
garnish and reveals its SECOND HEAD. This one too has an 
apple in its mouth.

Hey - it's a party. 
Satisfied, she covers it with a lid. Lurch then lifts

Especially considering what?

It makes no difference now. It's

assembled guests - but instead ABRUPTLY SPINS HIM BY 
THE ARM, sending him whirling like a top into the 
CENTER OF THE DANCE FLOOR 
where he suddenly STOPS, NOSE-TO-NOSE WITH GOMEZ. Gomez 
has changed clothes -- he's dressed now like a Hollywood 
Cossack. He carries FIVE GLEAMING SCIMITARS. 
Morticia, Granny, and all the Addams women rap out a 
stirring martial beat on tambourines. 
GOMEZ 
The Mamushka! 
Gomez begins to CIRCLE around Fester. 
The other family members form a ring, CIRCLING COUNTERCLOCKWISE 
to Gomez. 
Gomez then throws the scimitars straight up, high into 
the air, and begins juggling them. 
Baffled, Fester stands in the center, the eye of this 
dizzying hurricane. 
GOMEZ 
Taught to us by our Cossack cousins, 
the Mamushka has been an Addams family 
tradition since God-knows-when... 
Gomez hurls the scimitars to Fester. They begin JUGGLING 
THEM BACK AND FORTH -- MUCH TO FESTER'S SHOCK AND SURPRISE. 
GOMEZ 
...We danced the Mamushka while Nero 
fiddled! We danced the Mamushka at 
Waterloo! We danced the Mamushka for 
Jack the Ripper, and now, Fester 
Addams, this Mamushka's for you! 
The juggling continues. The MOVES GET MORE AND MORE 
INTRICATE. It's an ELABORATE, CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED 
ROUTINE. Fester, petrified, manages to somehow bungle 
his way through. 
They launch into a TONGUE-TWISTING PATTER SONG. Fester 
stumbles his way through. During an instrumental passage

Not a step, not a word... 
Fester has missed a beat and looks up to SEE -- 
ALL FIVE SCIMITARS -- 
DROPPING FAST, coming straight at him. 
Panicking, he CATCHES... ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR -- with 
two in each hand, his hands are full. What's he going 
to do with 
THE FIFTH SCIMITAR? 
HE OPENS HIS MOUTH TO SCREAM. IT DROPS STRAIGHT IN. HE 
SWALLOWS IT TO THE HILT. 
The Addams mob CHEERS LUSTILY and launches into the 
finale of the song. 
Amazed, Fester drops the scimitars he holds and pulls 
the one from his mouth. 
FESTER 
How did I do that? 
Gomez slaps him on the back. Fester burps. The Addams 
cheer again. They close in on Fester.

He begins to dance again. Abigail, breathing fire, sits 
on the bed, turning away from him. 
FESTER 
Mother? 
ABIGAIL 
Mother? Mother? Who is that? I 
don't think I recall. 
FESTER 
Mother... 
ABIGAIL 
I'm perfectly fine. I'm dandy. Don't 
concern yourself with me, Gordon. 
Please, return to your depraved orgy. 
Sometimes I think you're not even my son. 
FESTER 
Don't say that!
ABIGAIL 
I'm just your mother. You only owe me 
your entire existence on this planet. 
Please, Gordon, by all means - go. 
Sing. Dance. Date.

Look - our little boy. 
GOMEZ

Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting 
instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map 
of the area. 
GOMEZ 
Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung 
heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow 
graves. I'll take the abyss, and 
Lurch - check the bottomless pit. 
MORTICIA

Her favorite...
GOMEZ

Fester!! 
FESTER (O.S.) 
Up here. 
They look up at Fester, looking down at them from 
Wednesday's window. 
GOMEZ 
Fester! You take the ravine! And 
the unmarked, abandoned well! 
FESTER 
Somebody should stay behind - in

Relaxing. Taking a little sun.

Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and 
the stone doors slide open. He steps into - 
A124 INT. MAUSOLEUM - SAME TIME A124 
Inside it is catacomb-like, filled with the bleached 
bones of the Addams dead. Gomez's torch casts shadows 
-- one of which belongs to Wednesday, curled asleep on a 
stone sarcophagus. Relieved to find her, Gomez 
approaches quietly. He doesn't want to wake her up. He 
lifts her tenderly in his arms.

Gate can't open. He rattles miserably on his hinges --

large "NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!! ADDAMS FAMILY - 
KEEP OUT!!" signs are posted on Gate's rusty bars. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- 
the family, appalled at the sight of Gate. Lurch carries 
the sleeping Wednesday and Pugsley. 
GOMEZ 
What's all this? 
TULLY -- 
hurries down the walkway, waving his legal document. 
TULLY 
This is a restraining order, Gomez. 
GOMEZ 
A restraining order? 
TULLY 
It requires you to keep a distance of 
one thousand yards from this house. 
You've got about nine hundred and 
ninety-nine yards to go - catch my 
drift? 
GOMEZ 
(in disbelief) 
I am restrained - from my own house!? 
TULLY 
Not your house, moustache! Not any 
more! It belongs to the eldest living 
descendant, the older of the brothers 
-- Fester Addams! 
GOMEZ 
But - this is lunacy! 
MORTICIA 
Fester adores Gomez! 
TULLY 
He's afraid of him. Seeing the 
twins brought it all back.

You're bitter rivals, Gomez - always 
were, always will be!

GOMEZ

Do not fear - justic shall

JUDGE WOMACK 
Given applicable standards of

executor of the Addams estate and

his head thrown back. 
Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny

Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork. 
Granny joins her. 
GRANNY 
I like it. 
Her mother pats her consolingly. 
MORTICIA 
Just as long as we're together, 
n'est pas, mon cher? 
As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow 
-- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated 
plastic and orange shag carpet. 
GOMEZ 
sits slumped in a chair made from wagon wheel and naugahyde. 
It's as if all of his insane, vibrant energy has 
been leeched from him. He's a broken man. He looks back 
at her as if he's never heard French. 
GOMEZ 
Huh? 
Wednesday tends to him. She and her mother exchange a 
worried look. 
PUGSLEY 
comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel 
soap. 
PUGSLEY 
This place isn't so bad. They even 
put candy in the bathroom.

MOTEL SOAPS is beside him. 
In contrast, Morticia squarely faces the crisis. She 
addresses the family from the head of the breakfast 
table, the want ads open on the table before her. 
MORTICIA 
We are Addamses, and we will not 
submit. Who recalls the fable of 
the tortoise and the hare? The 
swift, yet lazy little cottontail, 
and his slow but determined companion? 
What does that story teach us, as 
Addamses? 
GRANNY 
Kill the hare. Skin it. Boil it.

They've slashed their prices to a nickel per cup. The 
pitcher on the table before them steams. 
Cars speed by. 
Carrying a SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER and a bucket, Lurch comes

SCREAMS in horror, turns to challenge the perpetrator of 
this atrocity and, seeing Lurch, SCREAMS again. 
In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like 
the salesman's manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his

Abigail exits. The minute the door shuts, Fester gets 
out of bed. He is fully clothed. He goes to the window, 
and begins to climb out.

Morticia, fully dressed, wearing her cloak, heads off

Stop it, you two. 
Morticia breaks free of Thing.

155 EXT. INTERSECTION AT THE FOOT OF THE ADDAMS HILL - NIGHT 155 
Thing does his damnedest to flag down any of the few 
oncoming cars. He waves to no avail, DANCES AROUND in 
frustration, then tries HITCHHIKING, sticking out his 
thumb. A passing car splashes him with mud. 
Screwing up his courage, in a kamikaze leap, he GRABS 
ahold of the bumper of the next car that comes along and 
hangs on for dear life as the car SPEEDS down the street. 
CUT TO: 
156 INT. STUDY - A LITTLE LATER 156 
Morticia is now stretched out on the torture RACK. Fester 
and Tully are securing her hands and feet, under Abigail's 
supervision. Fester seems torn, agitated, upset. 
MORTICIA 
(to Abigail, graciously) 
You are a desperate woman, consumed 
by greed and infinite bitterness. 
(a beat) 
We could have been such friends. 
ABIGAIL 
I don't think so. The vault, 
Mrs. Addams - any thoughts? 
MORTICIA 
(sweetly, to Abigail) 
Despite everything, I don't hate 
you. I pity you. Persecution, 
fiendish torture, inhuman depravity - 
sometimes it's just not enough. 
ABIGAIL 
Gordon - let's get started. 
FESTER 
But, Mother...

Stop stalling!

the rack) 
Do it! 
TULLY 
(to Morticia, 
politely) 
Where's your bathroom? 
ABIGAIL 
NOW! 
Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's 
bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She 
MOANS, rather sensually.
ABIGAIL 
Again! 
Tully tightens the rack again. More BONE-POPPING NOISES. 
Morticia MOANS again, even more orgasmically. 
ABIGAIL 
Tighter! 
Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES. 
Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes. 
She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully. 
MORTICIA 
(to Tully, flirtatiously) 
You've done this before.

He opens the door. Thing rushes in.

Parasite. How Gomez adored you. 
TULLY 
Well, not enough. 
FESTER 
Morticia, please... 
MORTICIA 
Dear Fester - or whomever you are. 
Which is the real you - the loathsome,

I was... restless! I couldn't sleep. 
ABIGAIL 
Gordon, I have a thought. Just a 
notion, top of my head. Tell me what 
you think. Since you and Mrs. Addams 
are so very close... 
Abigail takes a red-hot POKER out of the fire and hands it

Thing tosses Gomez a saber off the study wall. 
Tully also grabs a saber, and approaches Gomez from behind. 
MORTICIA 
Darling, take care! 
Without even looking, Gomez parries Tully's blow from 
behind. Then he whirls on Tully. 
GOMEZ 
Dirty pool, old man. Never again! 
TULLY 
This is for keeps, Gomez! Not 
just doubloons! 
Tully feints, then slashes - shredding the front of Gomez's 
jacket. 
GOMEZ 
One for you, Tully, and... 
Gomez ATTACKS - HIS BLADE FLASHING LIKE LIGHTNING. In a 
blur of action, Tully's sword is knocked from his hand and 
he's sent tumbling backwards, finally landing on his knees. 
GOMEZ 
... one for me! 
Tully looks up at Gomez with cowardly, pleading eyes. 
TULLY 
Gomez... it's Tully. I'm your

That's right! Now get moving - 
Addams, take him to the vault. 
And if you're not back in one 
hour...
(the pistol aimed 
at Morticia, and 
using her accent) 
I displace her. 
Gomez is near enough now to take Morticia's hand, on the 
torture wheel. 
GOMEZ 
Tish - seeing you like this. My 
blood boils. 
MORTICIA 
As does mine. 
GOMEZ

torture wheel) 
This wheel of pain...

FESTER 
But, Mother can't we... 
Gomez reaches for the book that will open the secret 
panel: 
ABIGAIL 
Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your 
feet! You disgust me - you're nothing 
but a useless, snivelling baby! A 
stone around my neck! What was I 
thinking - I should've left you where 
I found you! 
At Abigail's final words, Fester suddenly LEAPS FORWARD. 
FESTER 
No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong 
book! 
CLOSE UP 
Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester 
stops him from pulling it. 
FESTER 
Allow me... 
Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's 
about to do. 
GOMEZ

Good show, old man...

Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window. 
Then he blasts Abigail out as well. 
ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed", 
to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading 
Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the 
bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale

A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There 
is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN 
OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional 
Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton, 
etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle 
and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and 
he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the 
children CHANT: 
CHILDREN 
Trick or... 
They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened 
the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM 
IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street. 
CUT TO:

175 INT. FRONT HALL - SAME TIME 175 
Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled. 
The family is busily decorating the house for their annual 
Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant 
yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the 
chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack olanterns. 
Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from 
the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are 
clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with 
cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters 
and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe 
paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each 
holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and 
the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans 
against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat. 
A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the 
letters drip with blood. 
Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony. Morticia hands 
him a decoration. 
Granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food. 
GRANNY 
Well, it's their loss. I even 
made finger sandwiches. 
Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear. 
FESTER 
(petting Thing) 
Oh, calm down.
PUGSLEY (O.S.) 
Here we come! 
Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday 
is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as 
a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND 
GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down 
onto his feet. 
GOMEZ 
Pugsley, old man!

glows. It has ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD. 
Everyone oohs and ahhs.
